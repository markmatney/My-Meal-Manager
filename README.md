Our website uses a LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySql, PHP) based web structure. Set up your machine following the instructions of any of the links below:
MAC: jason.pureconcepts.net/2014/11/install-apache-php-mysql-mac-os-x-yosemite/
Ubuntu: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-linux-apache-mysql-php-lamp-stack-on-ubuntu
Windows: http://www.ultraedit.com/support/tutorials_power_tips/uestudio/local_php_mysql_dev_environment.html

Once your environment has been set up, copy all the files in the GitHub into your Web Document Root folder or the folder that your local server serves (differs depending on the system).

Set Up Database:
Download MySql and make sure that MySql server is running
Create a database called CS130.
As the root user, create a user "cs130" with password "test" and grant the new user with all privileges. This allows the files to access and modify the database.
Build the table schema with the createTables.sql script in the "database" folder.

To initialize it with recipe data, compile and run the web scraper code in the "webscraper" folder:

$ cd webscraper
$ javac RecipeSQLGen.java
$ java Main recipes CS130 | mysql -h localhost -u cs130 -ptest

And now your database is complete!
